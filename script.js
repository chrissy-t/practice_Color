/*To practice JavaScript events, create a webpage which can help people check if they have colour blindness.
 Create a grid of the colours of the rainbow that the user can select from.
Each grid cell should have an ID matching its colour (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo or violet).
Bind an event listener to the grid and use event delegation to determine which colour was clicked.
Place a message below the grid which asks the user to click on a particular colour and once clicked, 
update the message to let them know if they were correct or not */
